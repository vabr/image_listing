Template HTML for the image listing.

This template expects three input values to be replaced:
 ${PATH_TO_ROOT} should be replaced with the relative path to the root
   directory (e.g., ../../), and should be empty or end with "/".
 ${IMAGE_NAMES} should be the list of image names found in the current
   directory, enclosed in quotation marks and separated by commas (e.g.,
   "a.jpg", "b.jpg").
 ${DIR_NAMES} should similarly be the list of child directory names
   found in the current directory, in the same format as IMAGE_NAMES.
