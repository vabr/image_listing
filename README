The goal of the project is to provide useful directory listings for webservers
serving directories with images.

It consists of a script which can generate such listings as a static HTML with
some JavaScript and styling. This script takes the directory tree root as
input, crawls each directory to get a list of images stored in it, and writes
the listing as index.html in it.

The listing is largely based on the template also included in this project.
The input to the template is the list of image file names, and child
directories names. The script substitutes these values in the template to
generate the appropriate listing in each directory.

The image listing allows these actions:
* On load, it shows links to the parent and child directories, and thumbnails
  of the images. NOT IMPLEMENTED
  * TODO: Consider whether to also generate thumbnails on the fly.
    + Pros are the speed of loading them.
    - Cons are the need to store them, the additional code complexity, and the
      need to load the full images later.
* On tapping an image thumbnail, the image is displayed on the full width of
  the screen. Swiping left and right cycles between the images. Swiping up
  goes back into the listing view. NOT IMPLEMENTED

For swiping, https://hammerjs.github.io/ is used. A fixed version of it is
kept as third_party in the project.
